# Anime Watchlist


This WPF-Project has the purpose of managing the animes you have watched or still want to watch.

The animes are stored inside a SQLite-DB which is located inside the project folder.

States:
- Watched - You have already watched the anime
- Unwatched - You have not watched the anime
- In Progress - You are currently watching the anime
- Waiting - The anime is not finished and you are waiting for the next episodes
